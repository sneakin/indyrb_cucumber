Getting started

* Start a project
* Add plugin and/or install gem: [3520b57cf]
  * `git submodule add git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber.git vendor/plugins/cucumber`
  * `gem install cucumber`
  * Commit: 
* Generate Cucumber files
  * `./script/generate cucumber` [539a206a8f]
* Try it out
  * `rake features`

First story: [d70bb3f672f]

* Basic cucumber
* Will fill out a form that creates a record.
* Format
  * Header (boiler plate)
    * Title
    * Description
  * Scenarios
    * First scenario: happy ending [68881572]
      * Steps
      * Given/When/Then don't matter in step_definitions
    * Second scenario: not so happy [b072634954e]
    * Third?
      * Not needed here.
      * Stay DRY. Move to rspec for individual conditions such as trying each field for validity.

Second story:

* The story [2bf12bad1d7]
  * Deleting a story with Ajax  [2bf12bad1d]
    * Alert box
    * Dynamic page update
* Notes
  * Cucumber ignores confirmation messages
  * It follows the link's method, even though it's javascript

Selenium: [87771e9207]

* Is needed to test Javascript such as
  * Alert box
  * Ajax & Dynamic page updates
* Setup [http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/setting-up-selenium]
  * Install Selenium gem: http://selenium-rc.openqa.org
  * Copy selenium server over Webrat's version
  * Create directories to hold regular and Selenium features:
  * Create a cucumber.yml in RAILS_ROOT
  * Edit features/support/env.rb and create plain.rb and selenium.rb
  * Create a Rake task to run `cucumber -p selenium`
  * Copy story #2
* Things to note:
  * Same steps: redefines the common steps, makes it easy
  * JS related steps
  * Digging into Selenium commands: selenium-client's code: idiomatic.rb & generated_driver.rb
  * Will probably need to hack webrat to interface.

Third story?

* Prioritizing stories w/ drag and drop

Other cool stuff

* RCov [e8cb9350dca]
